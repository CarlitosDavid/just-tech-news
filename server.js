//  The router instance in routes/index.js collected everything for us and packaged them up for server.js to use.
// note we're importing the connection to Sequelize from config/connection.js. Then, at the bottom of the file, we use the sequelize.sync() method to establish the connection to the database.
// The "sync" part means that this is Sequelize taking the models and connecting them to associated database tables. If it doesn't find a table, it'll create it for you!
// The other thing to notice is the use of {force: false} in the .sync() method. 
// This doesn't have to be included, but if it were set to true, it would drop and re-create all of the database tables on startup.
