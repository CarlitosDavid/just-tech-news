{{!-- Why does Handlebars.js require a views folder? 
Why can't this be named something else? 
The reason for this is that Handlebars.js is meant to
 fit into an existing architectural paradigm 
 called Model-View-Controller, or MVC. --}}

<ol class="post-list">
    {{#each posts as |post|}}
  <li>
    <article class="post">
      <div class="title">
        <a href="{{post_url}}" target="_blank">{{post.title}}</a>
        <span>({{post.post_url}})</span>
      </div>
      <div class="meta">
        {{post.vote_count}} point(s) by {{post.user.username}} on
        {{post.created_at}}
        |
        <a href="/post/{{id}}">{{post.comments.length}} comment(s)</a>
      </div>
    </article>
  </li>
  {{/each}}
</ol>

{{!-- Within the {{#each}} block, Handlebars.js is smart enough to
 know that it's working with an object on each iteration, 
 so it looks for the necessary properties. 
 We can make this a little clearer, however, by declaring a variable
  name in the {{#each}} expression and using that name for the 
  subsequent placeholders. --}}
